# Minesweeper-Game
Personal Remake of the Game Minesweeper - C language
Examples of commands for the game: A1,B2,C3

where A,B,C represents the columns of the matrix that represent the minesweeper interface

where 1,2,3 represents the rows of the matrix that represent the minesweeper interface

if you want to mark a cell in the matrix, you can type the command !A1
