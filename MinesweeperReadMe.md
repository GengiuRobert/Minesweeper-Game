# Minesweeper-Game
Personal Remake of the Game Minesweeper - C language


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of commands for the game: A1,B2,C3

Where A,B,C represents the columns of the matrix that represent the minesweeper interface

Where 1,2,3 represents the rows of the matrix that represent the minesweeper interface

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to mark a cell in the matrix, you can type the command -> Example: !A1

If you want to discover a cell in the matrix, you can type the command -> Example: A1

The cells in the matrix that are the '.' character, are the discovered ones

The cells in the matrix that are the '?' character, are the undiscovered ones

The cells in the matrix that are the '!' character, are the marked ones

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the top, in main, there is a standard matrix that I used to work on, but if you want, you can create your own matrix

Also, you can hide that matrix if you want
